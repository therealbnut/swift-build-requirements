###About

These submodules are automatically updated by Swift's incremental build when Apple's continuous integration tests pass for each platform. The build status above should help you find a commit which is stable on your platform.

If you are interested in building Swift, please read the [documentation](https://github.com/apple/swift) in Swift's  main repository.

Please see [swift-incremental.yaml](swift-incremental.yaml) for detailed information on which tools where used to build each platform.
